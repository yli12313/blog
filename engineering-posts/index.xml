I’m also attaching a more recent picture of the robot! It is now a fully functioning robot. Overall it’s been a great experience and I’ve learned so much from the students. I would 100% become a volunteer again (if time avails). I’ve tried to add value to what the student’s have been doing with the robot.</description></item><item><title>Airflow Documentation</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/engineering-posts/20231221_airflow_documentation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2023 18:31:53 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/engineering-posts/20231221_airflow_documentation/</guid><description>These notes are taken from the official Apache Airflow website Documentation section. Will possibly need to reference these notes later. &amp;ldquo;Apache Airflow is an open source platform for developing, scheduling, and monitoring batch-oriented workflows. Airflow’s extensible Python framework enables you to build workflows connecting with virtually any technology. A web interface helps manage the state of your workflows. Airflow is deployable in many ways, varying from a single process on your laptop to a distributed setup to support even the biggest workflows.</description></item></channel></rss>
