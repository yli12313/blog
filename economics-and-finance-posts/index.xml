It&amp;rsquo;s been said that Dr. Malkiel has the common sense of Benjamin Franklin, the academic/insitutional knowledge of Dr. Milton Friedman and the practical experience of Warren Buffet.

Yes, the documentary is super dated because it came out in 2002; I could tell that it was pretty dated because of the music, the advertisements shown, and the people who were interviewed.</description></item></channel></rss>
