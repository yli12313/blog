&lt;p>“Adversity shaped me,” he (Musk) says. “My pain threshold become very high.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So I just finished reading the Walter Isaacson biography: &lt;em>Elon Musk&lt;/em>. My honest review of the book is that it’s ok. It’s not bad, not good; it’s average and I rate it 2.5/5. I first read Ashlee Vance’s book: &lt;em>Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future&lt;/em> back in 2015, and that was absolutely fantastic. Back then ~10 years ago, there was not that much known about Elon Musk or his background and work thus far. Elon was still kind of a mystery, and not the same Elon Musk that we know today. The Walter Isaacson book goes over Elon’s journey from childhood in South Africa to the end of 2022, when he bought Twitter and rebranded it as X.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
