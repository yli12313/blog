This was a really interesting documentary series that I first learned about from an article on the personal finance website Investopedia. The documentary series was a three-part series that went through the history of economics from it&amp;rsquo;s foundation to present day (i.e. the 21st century). Yes, the documentary is super dated because it came out in 2002; I could tell that it was pretty dated because of the music, the advertisements shown, and the people who were interviewed.</description></item></channel></rss>
