&lt;p>“Anyone who has a solid position elsewhere, let him stay where he is but for adventurers as myself I think they lose nothing in risking more.” - Vicent Van Gogh&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I finished reading the book &lt;strong>Vincent Van Gogh - A Life in Letters&lt;/strong> after a little over a year. This was an unbelievably long book to read, a super challenging read and it took endurance to finish. I saw my first and perhaps the most famous Van Gogh painting &lt;strong>The Starry Night&lt;/strong> in person back in December, 2024. I did an art project on &lt;em>The Starry Night&lt;/em> in middle school and it was cool for me to see it at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City) decades later. I did not know much about Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh before I read this book; it&amp;rsquo;s interesting that we all know the paintings, but not the person behind the famous paintings. I’m glad that I decided to investigate because I’ve learned a lot.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Essay Review: On the Shortness of Life - Seneca</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/autobiography-and-biography-posts/20251105_er_shortness_of_life/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 21:52:53 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/autobiography-and-biography-posts/20251105_er_shortness_of_life/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20251105_BR_Shortness_Of_Life/seneca.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>On the Shortness of Life by Seneca&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The essay &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://dn790008.ca.archive.org/0/items/SenecaOnTheShortnessOfLife/Seneca%20on%20the%20Shortness%20of%20Life.pdf">On the Shortness of Life&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> by &lt;strong>Lucius Annaeus Seneca (Seneca)&lt;/strong>, philosopher and statesman of Rome, is exactly the type of reading material that I enjoy (if you couldn’t tell already, Ancient Rome is an obsession of mine). &lt;em>Seneca&lt;/em> is one of the most respected philosophers in Ancient Rome. Born into a wealthy family in Córdoba, Hispania (modern-day Spain), Seneca moved to Rome as a child and received a very good education in philosophy and the liberal arts. He rose to prominence as a politician and was elected a &lt;em>quaestor&lt;/em> (finance official who managed treasury matters) in the Roman Senate in his early career. In AD 41, Seneca fell out of favor with Emperor Claudius and was exiled for eight years to the island of Corsica. A big remote island in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, Corsica was a super rough place to live. Because of his talent for the liberal arts, Seneca was called back to Rome at the request of Nero’s mother to become the full-time tutor of future Roman Emperor Nero. Nero is one of the most controversial figures in all of human history, and turned on Seneca as he gained power. In AD 65, Seneca died by forced suicide at the request of Emperor Nero and he died at age ~67-68.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Documentary Review: Empires - Napoleon</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/autobiography-and-biography-posts/20250830_dr_napoleon/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 23:02:22 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/autobiography-and-biography-posts/20250830_dr_napoleon/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250830_DR_Napoleon/napoleon.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really enjoyed the four-part mini-series &lt;strong>Empires - Napoleon&lt;/strong> from PBS (2000). It’s a pretty old documentary mini-series, but it was certainly very interesting. The documentary tells the whole life story of former French Emperor and General &lt;strong>Napoleon Bonaparte&lt;/strong>. Napoleon is an interesting historical figure and I’ve previously watched two movies on the guy: Napoleon (Ridley Scott; 2023) and Waterloo (Sergei Bondarchuk; 1970). I was not the biggest fan of the Ridley Scott film Napoleon, but Waterloo was an interesting film. I wanted to write a blog for the Napoleon documentary because this was an exceptionally well-made documentary that had some very interesting content.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book Review: Meditations - Marcus Aurelius</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/autobiography-and-biography-posts/20250412_br_meditations/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 15:38:16 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/autobiography-and-biography-posts/20250412_br_meditations/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250412_BR_Meditations/cover.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I finished reading my first book of the year! I finished reading &lt;strong>Meditations&lt;/strong> by Emperor &lt;strong>Marcus Aurelius&lt;/strong>, who was Emperor of Rome from 161-180 AD. This is a famous book that I’ve heard about for many years, but I had never taken the time to actually read it carefully until this year. In a way, this book has influenced me for decades now because it’s the inspiration for the two Ridley Scott films: &lt;strong>Gladiator&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Gladiator II&lt;/strong>. &lt;em>Gladiator&lt;/em> is one of my favorite movies ever and I must have watched the movie more than five times! &lt;em>Gladiator II&lt;/em> came out more recently in 2024, and it was ok. It was never going to be as good as the original, no matter what they did. I, along with many other guys, love the movie &lt;em>Gladiator&lt;/em> because I love the way the protagonist &lt;strong>Maximus Decimus Meridius&lt;/strong> dealt with adversity, kept fighting, and never gave up, even when all hope seemed lost. The movie was a fictional account of real events and people, but it was so vivid and well done that it brought to life the Stoic principles and Stoicism advocated by Emperor &lt;em>Marcus Aurelius&lt;/em>. I just knew I had to read &lt;em>Meditations&lt;/em> and made an earnest effort to read it starting last year. It was a very challenging read and I found a good translation of the book from late 19th century London, U.K. The English phrases and vernacular are not written in a way that’s common today, so I had to spend time carefully parsing the meaning of passages, as well as use Claude.ai to help me understand super challenging passages. Nevertheless, I finished reading the book and there is so much WISDOM in the book from a truly deep thinker! Some of the ideas are super practical in our day-to-day lives. Here are my five favorite quotes about Stoicism from the &lt;em>Meditations&lt;/em> of Emperor &lt;em>Marcus Aurelius&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book Review: War Commentaries of Caesar</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/autobiography-and-biography-posts/20240728_br_war_commentaries/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 12:18:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/autobiography-and-biography-posts/20240728_br_war_commentaries/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20240728_BR_War_Commentaries/cover.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I try to read one biography or autobiography a year and I just finished reading the &lt;strong>War Commentaries of Caesar&lt;/strong>, translated by &lt;em>Rex Warner&lt;/em>. This book is the autobiographical account of Roman Proconsul and General &lt;strong>Julius Caesar&lt;/strong>, who has left us a first person account in great detail of his various military campaigns. The book is divided into two parts: &lt;strong>1)&lt;/strong> &lt;em>The Gallic Wars&lt;/em> (58-50 BC) and &lt;strong>2)&lt;/strong> &lt;em>The Civil Wars&lt;/em> (49-48 BC). Here’s a quick summary of the book: Caesar was able to take Gaul (present day France) and Britanni (present day U.K.) after much struggle, and was lauded as a hero back in Rome at the conclusion of the Gallic Wars. However disagreements with the Roman Senate and his once friend Pompey resulted in a bloody civil war where Romans were fighting other Romans around present day southern France, Spain, and North Africa. Pompey et al. subsequently lost the civil wars and Caesar appointed himself dictator, administered elections as a dictator, and instigated the change from the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. Lesson learned: as much as people are lauded for their strengths and achievements, they also inevitably have weaknesses too.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
