&lt;p>I finished reading my first book of the year! I finished reading &lt;strong>Meditations&lt;/strong> by Emperor &lt;strong>Marcus Aurelius&lt;/strong>, who was Emperor of Rome from 161-180 AD. This is a famous book that I’ve heard about for many years, but I had never taken the time to actually read it carefully until this year. In a way, this book has influenced me for decades now because it’s the inspiration for the two Ridley Scott films: &lt;strong>Gladiator&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Gladiator II&lt;/strong>. &lt;em>Gladiator&lt;/em> is one of my favorite movies ever and I must have watched the movie more than five times! &lt;em>Gladiator II&lt;/em> came out more recently in 2024, and it was ok. It was never going to be as good as the original, no matter what they did. I, along with many other guys, love the movie &lt;em>Gladiator&lt;/em> because I love the way the protagonist &lt;strong>Maximus Decimus Meridius&lt;/strong> dealt with adversity, kept fighting, and never gave up, even when all hope seemed lost. The movie was a fictional account of real events and people, but it was so vivid and well done that it brought to life the Stoic principles and Stoicism advocated by Emperor Marcus Aurelius. I just knew I had to read &lt;strong>Meditations&lt;/strong> and made an earnest effort to read it starting last year. It was a very challenging read and I found a good translation of the book from late 19th century London, U.K. The English phrases and vernacular are not written in a way that’s common today, so I had to spend time carefully parsing the meaning of passages, as well as use Claude.ai to help me understand super challenging passages. Nevertheless, I finished reading the book and there is so much WISDOM in the book from a truely deep thinker! Some of the ideas are super practical in our day-to-day lives. Here are my five favorite quotes about Stoicism from the &lt;strong>Meditations&lt;/strong> of Emperor &lt;em>Marcus Aurelius&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book Review: War Commentaries of Caesar</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/biography-posts/20240728_war_commentaries/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 12:18:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/biography-posts/20240728_war_commentaries/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20240728_War_Commentaries/cover.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I try to read one biography or autobiography a year and I just finished reading the &lt;strong>War Commentaries of Caesar&lt;/strong>, translated by &lt;em>Rex Warner&lt;/em>. This book is the autobiographical account of Roman proconsul and general &lt;strong>Julius Caesar&lt;/strong>, who has left us a first person account in great detail of his various military campaigns. The book is divided into two parts: &lt;strong>1)&lt;/strong> &lt;em>The Gallic Wars&lt;/em> (58-50 BC) and &lt;strong>2)&lt;/strong> &lt;em>The Civil Wars&lt;/em> (49-48 BC). Here’s a quick summary of the book: Caesar was able to take Gaul (present day France) and Britanni (present day U.K.) after much struggle, and was lauded as a hero back in Rome at the conclusion of the Gallic Wars. However disagreements with the Roman Senate and his once friend Pompey resulted in a bloody civil war where Romans were fighting other Romans around present day southern France, Spain, and North Africa. Pompey et al. subsequently lost the civil wars and Caesar appointed himself dictator, administered elections as a dictator, and thus changed the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. Lesson learned: as much as people are lauded for their strengths and achievements, they also inevitably have weaknesses too.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
