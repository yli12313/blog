So I recently went to **FÃªte de la Musique** (World Music Day) at the French Embassy in Georgetown, Washington D.C. I went with a friend and had no idea what to expect! I almost didnâ€™t go because I had no idea what kind of music they were going to play at the event. All I knew was that there was no entrance fee, which is a rarity for an embassy event. To be honest, this was the main driving force behind why I wanted to go: it was free and I had never been to the French Embassy before.

When we got there, the party was already in full swing! There were lots of people there from all different backgrounds: students, working professionals, embassy workers, families, retirees, etc. Definitely very eclectic. The energy was awesome and the music was very good for a free event. The embassy did charge for food and drinks, but it was reasonable for D.C. I really loved the energy of the event even though my friend and I didnâ€™t know anyone at this event. We talked to some interesting people as we waited in line for drinks as well as when we sat on the grass hill listening to the live music. After a band played, there was even a live DJ playing really awesome EDM and house music, so dope. Honestly, this festival has revived my interest and passion in learning the French language. I will get on top of it and master the French language sooner or later! ðŸ˜€
