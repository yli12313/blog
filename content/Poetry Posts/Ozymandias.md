**Ozymandias by Percy Bysshe Shelley**

> I met a traveller from an antique land,  
> Who said — “Two vast and trunkless legs of stone  
> Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,  
> Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,  
> And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,  
> Tell that its sculptor well those passions read  
> Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,  
> The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;  
> And on the pedestal, these words appear:  
> My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;  
> Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!  
> Nothing beside remains. Round the decay  
> Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare  
> The lone and level sands stretch far away.”  

**Ozymandias** is an interesting poem that tells us nothing lasts forever. It tells the story of a narrator who talks to a traveller who returned from a land far away. The traveler tells the narrator of their adventures in the desert, especially an encounter with a statue of the former king: Ozymandias. Ozymandias proclaimed himself “King of Kings” and once ruled the land. Yet all that’s left of his might and power is a broken statue in the desert. The statue captures Ozymandias’s temperament, his “wrinkled lip” and “sneer of cold command”. Ozymandias thought he could be immortal by leaving a statue of himself for posterity, yet time stops for no one. Ozymandias is long gone and his statue is broken in pieces covered with sand. 

The lesson is not complicated: *forget legacy and do what you enjoy; do things not for any external validation but for yourself. In the end, no one will remember you or I across the vast expanse of time anyway*.
