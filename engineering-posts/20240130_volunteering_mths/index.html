<a href=https://yli12313.github.io/blog/engineering-posts/20240130_volunteering_mths/ class=bread-btn>Volunteering at McKinley Technology High School</a></div></div><nav id=TableOfContents></nav><div class=content><p><img src=/blog/20240130_Volunteering_MTHS/robot.png alt=p1></p><p>Iâ€™ve recently started volunteering again for the non-profit organization <strong>RESET</strong> (<strong>R</strong>aising <strong>E</strong>xcitment for Science, <strong>E</strong>ngineering, and <strong>T</strong>echnology) after an almost two year hiatus. I last volunteered for RESET from Fall,2019 - Spring,2022. In previous volunteering opportunities, I was always working with middle school students teaching Scratch (which is a programming language that is geared towards middle school students to get them interested in coding), but this year Iâ€™m working with high school students on a robotics competition at <strong>McKinley Technology High School</strong> in NE, Washington D.C. The students are high school sophomores to seniors and some of them are quite advanced in their technical abilities. Some are extremely strong in electrical and mechanical engineering whereas others are extremely strong in software engineering. Itâ€™s very clear to me that some of them are going to excel when they go to college to study any of the engineering disciplines.</p><p>The robot that the team is trying to build is for the <strong>First Robotics Competition</strong> (<em>see picture above</em>). This is a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOz55ATplok&amp;ab_channel=UnqualifiedQuokkas">video</a> from another team that demonstrates the full repertoire of the robot and what it should do in order to win the maximum number of points in the competition. As you can see from the video, the robot has to move autonomously around an obstacle course and intake orange plastic rings. Then the robot has to shoot the rings into designated receptacles from near and far distances. Ideally in the end, the robot is also able to leverage a robotic arm for climbing purposes. The movement around the obstacle course has to be precise, the intake of the orange rings has to be precise, and the shooting of the orange rings into receptacles has to be precise, with enough velocity to hit the target but not overshoot it.</p><p>Iâ€™ve always enjoyed working for RESET because of what I learn about myself everytime. I find that when Iâ€™m working/helping young people, I learn more from them than they learn from me. The way that Iâ€™ve tried to add value to the team is to help them with:</p><ol><li><strong>Software troubleshooting</strong>, where I introduced to some team members the power of <strong>Microsoft Bingâ€™s Copilot</strong> search tool. Whenever they face a software difficulty, I showed the software team that they can always input the error into Microsoft Bingâ€™s Copilot (a ChatGPT4 conversational chatbot search tool) to quickly diagnose the error.</li><li><strong>Project planning</strong>, where I help the team define tasks that need to be done per week. I help the team breakdown tasks, assign deadlines and define whoâ€™s responsible for each task. This makes individual team members accountable for their individual tasks and helps them make progress each and every week.</li></ol><p>I could see myself eventually getting my hands dirty and doing some of the electrical and mechanical engineering myself! I think tinkering is so cool and thatâ€™s what engineering is really all about. Itâ€™s about working on a cool project with a good group of people, such that the end product is so much bigger and better than what an individual could build by him or herself alone. The electronics with regard to this robot is pretty complex with lots of communications equipment that interfaces with both the hardware and software; configuring and wiring the communications equipment is quite the challenge. Iâ€™m not at that level yet where I can contribute to the hardware/network engineering, but maybe I can learn. Other things Iâ€™ve learned so far from volunteering with the these high students so far:</p><ul><li>Just do stuff; canâ€™t make progress if you are not in there getting your hands dirty.</li><li>Have fun and enjoy working with new tools and new people.</li><li>Take action and make it happen; find a way or make a way. The idea, no matter how far-fetched in the beginning, can be refined as you start doing stuff. The initial idea is most likely wrong, so you have to shape it such that you get closer to the truth.</li></ul><p>Pretty cool! ðŸ’¯</p></div></article></main><footer class=footer><div class=footer-left><ul class=social><li>All Rights Reserved Â® 2024.</li><li>Yingquan Li</li></ul></div><div class=footer-right><ul class="control status clearfix"><li>Word Count:
