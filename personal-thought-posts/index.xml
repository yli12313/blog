Just super frustrating when you try things and they don’t turn out to be what you expect or you can’t get it to work.

I just felt like the output was not good enough, so I decided to archive each project and move on to new projects. It’s always exciting to start something new; the beginning is so fun! And then you hit turbulence and roadblocks. You try, try, try and then realize the &lt;strong>sunk-cost fallacy&lt;/strong> is way too overwhelming to continue. You abandon the project in the middle and it never really finishes or is in a state that would make it presentable.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
