This was a really interesting documentary series that I first learned about from an article on the personal finance website Investopedia. This documentary series is a three-part series that goes through the history of economics from it&amp;rsquo;s foundation to present day (i.e. the 21st century). Yes, the documentary is super dated because it came out in 2002; I could tell that it was pretty dated because of the music, the advertisements shown, and the people who were interviewed.</description></item><item><title>Hugo Reference</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/hugo-reference/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2023 19:23:51 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/hugo-reference/</guid><description> This is how you create a link to Yahoo.
