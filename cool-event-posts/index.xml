I was originally slated to go to PyCon in the year 2020 also in Pittsburgh, but the pandemic disrupted the conference (I had the hotel and conference ticket booked at the time). I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to attend PyCon and have been a Python user since I was 18. At PyCon, I was most surprised by the amount of people from all around the world who are Python developers!</description></item><item><title>Volunteering at McKinley Technology High School</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-posts/20240130_volunteering_mths/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 18:11:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-posts/20240130_volunteering_mths/</guid><description>Update (Sat. 3/17/24 @ 1:48 AM EST): I’m writing to give an update on my experiences volunteering at McKinley Technology High School in NE, Washington D.C. I’m also attaching a more recent picture of the robot! It is now a fully functioning robot. Overall it’s been a great experience and I’ve learned so much from the students. I would 100% become a volunteer again (if time avails). I’ve tried to add value to what the student’s have been doing with the robot.</description></item></channel></rss>
