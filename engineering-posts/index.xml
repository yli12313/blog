I’m also attaching a more recent picture of the robot! It is now a fully functioning robot. Overall it’s been a great experience and I’ve learned so much from the students. I would 100% become a volunteer again (if time avails). I’ve tried to add value to what the student’s have been doing with the robot.</description></item></channel></rss>
