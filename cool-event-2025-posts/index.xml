&lt;p>This event happened around ~1.5 months ago and Iâ€™m only blogging about it now. I decided to become a mentor at &lt;strong>George Hacks&lt;/strong>, which is a student-led innovation hackathon at George Washington University (GWU). I saw an event notice saying they were looking for mentors on a public Slack channel. I felt like I could give some good advice (potentially) to some of the student teams and help them brainstorm solutions. I did it with the intention of making a difference and with the mindset to help and to serve. I wanted to represent the organizers of the hackathon with honor and integrity most of all!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
