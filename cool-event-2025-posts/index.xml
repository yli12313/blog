&lt;p>I went to &lt;strong>FÃªte de la Musique&lt;/strong> (World Music Day) at the French Embassy again this year. The party happened ~three months ago on Sat. 6/21/25 and I have to say it was pretty good again this year! There were lots of very interesting people there and definitely it had good vibes. The line to get into the embassy was a little rough, but I made it in again this year. Once I got in, the crowd was massive and it was definitely a bit overwhelming. I was lucky that my friend showed up later during the event too, so I at least had one person there that I knew. We went around the venue and listened to different types of music, where most of the musicians there were actually American and DMV local artists. That didnâ€™t affect the vibes! Then when it got dark into the night, thatâ€™s when the party really began. They brought out two DJs who played French house music; thatâ€™s when the party really started. People were dancing into the night under a clear sky filled with stars. It was truly magical and definitely better than last year. This year I stayed until the very end and felt energized after the end of the event. It was definitely super awesome and I would totally recommend it to anyone who likes to have a good time. Just look at the people in the video, FUN!! Partying in the summer is a good way to enjoy life!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI Expo Hackathon</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250830_ai_expo_hackathon/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 17:27:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250830_ai_expo_hackathon/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250830_AI_Expo_Hackathon/hackathon.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This event happened back in June (Mon. 6/2/25 - Wed. 6/4/25) and it was a pretty cool event! I was invited to a national AI hackathon sponsored by OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic and AGI House. The hackathon was happening in conjunction with the SCSP AI+ Expo at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington D.C. I was encouraged by multiple people from AGI House to apply to the hackathon and thankfully I got in! I was extremely excited to go to the event given the excellent hackathon I went to earlier this year, also sponsored by SCSP and AGI House. The AI Expo happened last year too, but I was not able to go. Therefore I was equally excited to go to the Expo myself and check out some of the vendors there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Conference Review: PyCon US 2025 (Pittsburgh)</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250719_pycon/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2025 20:01:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250719_pycon/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250719_PyCon/pycon.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went to &lt;strong>PyCon&lt;/strong> (Fri. 5/16/25 - Sun. 5/18/25) again this year. The more I write, the more I realize how incredible my PyCon 2025 experience really was. This is the second year in a row that I went to PyCon and it was lovely overall because the conference was held in Pittsburgh again. Pittsburgh is only a five-hour drive from where I live, so there was no way that I was going to miss PyCon. Next year it will be held in Long Beach, CA and Iâ€™m not sure if I will be able to go. Therefore, I had to make the most of this opportunity. I stayed with a friend in North Oakland right near Carnegie Mellon U., which is a really nice school with a fantastic campus. Loved walking around the campus, which was very modern. Moreover my ticket was paid for by my work, so overall it was very cost-effective for me to go.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hubble Space Telescope: 35-Year Celebration</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250622_hubble/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2025 19:22:13 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250622_hubble/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250622_Hubble/hubble.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of a work perk, I was invited to the &lt;strong>Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/strong> 35-year celebration at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland, located on the campus of Johns Hopkins University (JHU). This was a surprising treat for me because I didnâ€™t anticipate receiving an invitation to this event. As someone relatively new to the institute, this invite-only event was more for senior-level people, but I somehow received an invite. There was no way I was going to miss it! I drove up to Baltimore that day (Thu. 4/24/25) feeling very good. It was definitely very special and a unique honor for me, given that I grew up with the Hubble.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI Agents for Defense and Gov.

&lt;em>Hacking with my team along with some Maryland Terps seated right next to us!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This event happened a couple months ago (Sat. 3/29/25) and it was certainly very cool, so I donâ€™t want to forget about it. I saw that the &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.scsp.ai/">Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP)&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> was going to host its second hackathon in Crystal City, Virginia. This was a one-day hackathon with a total prize pool of $50K. Thatâ€™s a lot of money for a one day hackathon! For those who are unfamiliar, SCSP.ai is the brainchild of former Google Chairman/CEO Eric Schmidt. The organizationâ€™s goal is to study and make policy recommendations on how to stay competitive with respect to artificial intelligence (AI). We all know that AI technology is one of the bedrocks of currently ongoing great powers competition among nation-states. I didnâ€™t end up going to the first hackathon last year because I didnâ€™t know about it, but I learned about this second hackathon from my friend. He went to the first one and said it was very fancy and very well done. I wanted to see for myself what SCSP.aiâ€™s hackathons were really like. I didnâ€™t know what to expect, but I decided to just sign up and show up. Sometimes thatâ€™s the key to everything, you know? &lt;strong>Have a nose for opportunity and just show up when others are not willing to&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Volunteering at George Hacks</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250423_george_hacks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 16:29:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250423_george_hacks/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250423_George_Hacks/george_hacks.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This event happened around ~1.5 months ago (Sat. 3/1/25 - Sun. 3/2/25) and Iâ€™m only blogging about it now. I decided to become a mentor at &lt;strong>George Hacks&lt;/strong>, which is a student-led innovation hackathon at &lt;strong>George Washington University&lt;/strong> (GWU). I saw an event notice saying they were looking for mentors on a public Slack channel. I felt like I could give good advice to some of the student teams and help them brainstorm solutions. I did it with the intention of making a difference and the mindset to help and to serve. I wanted to represent the organizers of the hackathon with honor and integrity most of all! I had no idea what to expect when I signed up as a mentor, but Iâ€™m very glad that I did it looking back.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
