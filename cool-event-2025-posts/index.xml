&lt;p>I was given the opportunity by my friend to be a keynote speaker for the &lt;strong>Data Engineering D.C.&lt;/strong> (&lt;strong>DEDC&lt;/strong>) Meetup on Wed. 8/27/25. This was right after I officially joined &lt;strong>Data Community D.C.&lt;/strong> (&lt;strong>DC2&lt;/strong>) as a volunteer. I joined as a DC2 volunteer because I previously had ~3 years of experience organizing &lt;strong>Data Science Philadelphia&lt;/strong> (&lt;strong>DataPhilly&lt;/strong>). I learned a lot from my experience working for DataPhilly and wanted to continue making a difference and helping people in the data community. I felt that I could bring energy to some of the meetups in the D.C. area and was bidding my time to find the right opportunity. DEDC was restarted in 2025 and had good momentum going, hosting events once every month from January - May (of which many I attended). After May, I felt perhaps the momentum was waning and the group needed some energy. I contacted my friend Will Angel to not only be a speaker, but also a volunteer for the group and the rest was history.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Baseball Games</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20260101_baseball/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:50:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20260101_baseball/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20260101_Baseball/nats.png" alt="p1">

&lt;em>Watching my first and second Major League Baseball (MLB) games ever at Nats Park (Washington D.C.) and Camden Yards (Baltimore, MD)!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m finishing up my blog posts for the year 2025, even though today is New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day 2026. I went to my first two baseball games last year. I went to a &lt;em>Nats x Mets&lt;/em> game on Tue. 8/19/25 and I went to an &lt;em>Orioles x Yankees&lt;/em> game on Thu. 9/18/25. I used to be a bigger baseball fan when I was younger, but over the course of time lost interest in following the sport closely. When I was young living in New England, I saw the Red Sox win two World Series in the 2000s. That was pretty exciting and I followed the sport and knew some of the players, but not the rules seriously. Before 2025, the last time I seriously watched a baseball game was the 2016 World Series with the Chicago Cubs winning. I had a co-worker who was a big baseball fan and we watched one World Series game in College Park, MD. He taught me some of the rules of the game and I was impressed by his passion. This co-worker played in high school and that passion was infectious.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>4th of July 🇺🇸</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20251205_4th_of_july/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 16:06:48 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20251205_4th_of_july/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20251205_4th_Of_July/fireworks.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m reflecting on the 4th of July months after the fact because I had a more interesting 4th of July this year than any other year! I finally went down to the National Mall to see the fireworks for the first time ever. I’ve never had the desire to see fireworks in D.C. because I’ve felt that it would be too chaotic and too much of a hassle. This year I went by myself and then synced up with a friend at the last minute; it turned out better than expected. I got to see the fireworks at a nice location on the Mall and there were some really impressive and colorful explosions. This was probably the first time I’ve seen fireworks since the early 2000s so it was a treat for me. Will I go see fireworks again next year? Probably not because of the overcrowdedness. I would rather stay at home and sleep or do my own thing, which is what I’ve done historically.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Summer Soirée at the French Embassy x2! 🇫🇷</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250925_french_embassy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 00:38:38 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250925_french_embassy/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250925_French_Embassy/french_embassy.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went to &lt;strong>Fête de la Musique&lt;/strong> (World Music Day) at the French Embassy again this year. The party happened ~three months ago on Sat. 6/21/25 and I have to say it was pretty good again this year! There were lots of very interesting people present and it definitely had good vibes. The line to get into the embassy was a little rough, but I made it in after a long wait. Once I got in, the crowd was massive and it was definitely a bit overwhelming. I was lucky that my friend showed up later during the event, so at least I had one person there that I knew. We went around the venue and listened to different types of music; most of the musicians there were actually American and DMV local artists. That didn’t affect the vibes! When it got dark later into the night, that’s when the party really began. They brought out two DJs who played French house music; the techno/house music truly brought out the energy in everyone. People were dancing into the night under a very clear sky filled with stars. It was truly magical and definitely better than last year. This year I stayed until the very end and felt energized after the event ended. It was definitely super awesome and I would totally recommend it to anyone who likes to have a good time. Just look at the people in the videos, FUN!! Life can be pretty cool sometimes!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI Expo Hackathon</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250830_ai_expo_hackathon/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 17:27:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250830_ai_expo_hackathon/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250830_AI_Expo_Hackathon/hackathon.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This event happened back in June (Mon. 6/2/25 - Wed. 6/4/25) and it was a pretty cool event! I was invited to a national AI hackathon sponsored by OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic and AGI House. The hackathon was happening in conjunction with the SCSP AI+ Expo at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington D.C. I was encouraged by multiple people from AGI House to apply to the hackathon and thankfully I got in! I was extremely excited to go to the event given the excellent hackathon I went to earlier this year, also sponsored by SCSP and AGI House. The AI Expo happened last year too, but I was not able to go. Therefore I was equally excited to go to the Expo myself and check out some of the vendors there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Conference Review: PyCon US 2025 (Pittsburgh)</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250719_pycon/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2025 20:01:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250719_pycon/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250719_PyCon/pycon.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went to &lt;strong>PyCon&lt;/strong> (Fri. 5/16/25 - Sun. 5/18/25) again this year. The more I write, the more I realize how incredible my PyCon 2025 experience really was. This is the second year in a row that I went to PyCon and it was lovely overall because the conference was held in Pittsburgh again. Pittsburgh is only a five-hour drive from where I live, so there was no way that I was going to miss PyCon. Next year it will be held in Long Beach, CA and I’m not sure if I will be able to go. Therefore, I had to make the most of this opportunity. I stayed with a friend in North Oakland right near Carnegie Mellon U., which is a really nice school with a fantastic campus. Loved walking around the campus, which was very modern. Moreover my ticket was paid for by my work, so overall it was very cost-effective for me to go.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hubble Space Telescope: 35-Year Celebration</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250622_hubble/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2025 19:22:13 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250622_hubble/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250622_Hubble/hubble.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of a work perk, I was invited to the &lt;strong>Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/strong> 35-year celebration at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland, located on the campus of Johns Hopkins University (JHU). This was a surprising treat for me because I didn’t anticipate receiving an invitation to this event. As someone relatively new to the institute, this invite-only event was more for senior-level people, but I somehow received an invite. There was no way I was going to miss it! I drove up to Baltimore that day (Thu. 4/24/25) feeling very good. It was definitely very special and a unique honor for me, given that I grew up with the Hubble.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI Agents for Defense and Gov.

&lt;em>Hacking with my team along with some Maryland Terps seated right next to us!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This event happened a couple months ago (Sat. 3/29/25) and it was certainly very cool, so I don’t want to forget about it. I saw that the &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.scsp.ai/">Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP)&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> was going to host its second hackathon in Crystal City, Virginia. This was a one-day hackathon with a total prize pool of $50K. That’s a lot of money for a one day hackathon! For those who are unfamiliar, SCSP.ai is the brainchild of former Google Chairman/CEO Eric Schmidt. The organization’s goal is to study and make policy recommendations on how to stay competitive with respect to artificial intelligence (AI). We all know that AI technology is one of the bedrocks of currently ongoing great powers competition among nation-states. I didn’t end up going to the first hackathon last year because I didn’t know about it, but I learned about this second hackathon from my friend. He went to the first one and said it was very fancy and very well done. I wanted to see for myself what SCSP.ai’s hackathons were really like. I didn’t know what to expect, but I decided to just sign up and show up. Sometimes that’s the key to everything, you know? &lt;strong>Have a nose for opportunity and just show up when others are not willing to&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Volunteering at George Hacks</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250423_george_hacks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 16:29:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250423_george_hacks/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250423_George_Hacks/george_hacks.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This event happened around ~1.5 months ago (Sat. 3/1/25 - Sun. 3/2/25) and I’m only blogging about it now. I decided to become a mentor at &lt;strong>George Hacks&lt;/strong>, which is a student-led innovation hackathon at &lt;strong>George Washington University&lt;/strong> (GWU). I saw an event notice saying they were looking for mentors on a public Slack channel. I felt like I could give good advice to some of the student teams and help them brainstorm solutions. I did it with the intention of making a difference and the mindset to help and to serve. I wanted to represent the organizers of the hackathon with honor and integrity most of all! I had no idea what to expect when I signed up as a mentor, but I’m very glad that I did it looking back.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
