&lt;p>I finished reading the book: &lt;strong>Wonders of the Universe&lt;/strong> (The World Book) earlier this year. This is an older astronomy book from ~30 years ago, but I decided to re-read it again this year. I had this book since childhood, but had lost it over the years until I found it again this year in a pile of books located in the house. I last saw this book probably ~20 years ago, and I was definitely surprised my family kept it all these years. This book is from &lt;em>The World Book Encyclopedia&lt;/em>, which is a resource I used to read religiously in middle school. There was a World Book app on the Apple laptop my school allowed us to use, and I would read it all the time. I read it as an escape, given that I didnâ€™t go out much nor was I involved in too many after school activities. Astronomy was one of my favorite subjects growing up and to be working in astrophysics today, it really has come full circle.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
