I’m really happy I finally finished reading this book. I tried reading it for the first time back in 2016 and was not able to do so. At the time, the book was way too advanced for me and I didn’t have the background knowledge to be able to really understand it at a deep level.</description></item><item><title>Book Review: Titan: The Life of John D.

This was a really interesting documentary series that I first learned about from an article on the personal finance website Investopedia. This documentary series is a three-part series that goes through the history of economics from it&amp;rsquo;s foundation to present day (i.e. the 21st century). Yes, the documentary is super dated because it came out in 2002; I could tell that it was pretty dated because of the music, the advertisements shown, and the people who were interviewed.</description></item></channel></rss>
