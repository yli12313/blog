It sucks when you try things and they don’t work out. Just super frustrating when you try things and they don’t turn out to be what you expect or you can’t get it to work. I tried to build three different projects in my spare time this year and none have turned out the way that I thought they would. I just felt like the output was not good enough, so I decided to archive each project and move on to new projects. It’s always exciting to start something new; the beginning is so fun! And then you hit turbulence and roadblocks. You try, try, try and then realize the **sunk-cost fallacy** is way too overwhelming to continue. You abandon the project in the middle and it never really finishes or is in a state that would make it presentable. 

* I tried to make a chess project that would enable me to analyze the moves of chess grand masters, with the hope that it would improve my chess game.
* I tried to make a data visualization of Napoleon’s military conquests and just a simple viz of all his wins and losses as well as the location where each battle happened.
* I tried to make a Docker, Kubernetes and Airflow project where Airflow would be containerized and deployed via Kubernetes. This project I still want to continue, but start in a new way. 

Nothing seems to ever work the first time. It seems like everything worthwhile takes arduous hours of experimentation, pain, and stress. Yet if we don’t push ourselves out of our comfort zones, we remain stagnant and never grow. I used to think that you win or you lose, but I realized more recently it’s actually **you win or you learn**. The more things we try, the more we grow and the more we enhance our neural network pathways to take on new, exciting challenges. We should be excited to fail and experiment. This is a mental model that I’m incorporating into my thinking far more than before. It’s ok to crash and burn. Why not and what’s there to lose? It’s really nothing; fear is what keeps most people from reaching their full potential. It’s simple: remove the fear by just doing things, whether you feel like doing it or not. This is easier said than done, but it starts with the mind. When you configure your mindset to embrace failing, you become more open-minded and more solutions-oriented. It’s time to strive forward with great zeal and gusto, and reframe each setback as an opportunity!
