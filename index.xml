It&amp;rsquo;s been said that Dr. Malkiel has the common sense of Benjamin Franklin, the academic/insitutional knowledge of Dr. Milton Friedman and the practical experience of Warren Buffet. His investment advice is considered by the Wall St. Journal to be &amp;ldquo;the best and latest investment advice money can buy.</description></item><item><title>Volunteering at McKinley Technology High School</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/engineering-posts/20240130_volunteering_mths/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 18:11:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/engineering-posts/20240130_volunteering_mths/</guid><description>Update (Sat. 3/17/24 @ 1:48 AM EST): I’m writing to give an update on my experiences volunteering at McKinley Technology High School in NE, Washington D.C. I’m also attaching a more recent picture of the robot! It is now a fully functioning robot. Overall it’s been a great experience and I’ve learned so much from the students. I would 100% become a volunteer again (if time avails). I’ve tried to add value to what the student’s have been doing with the robot.</description></item><item><title>Book Review: Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20240130_br_titan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 16:59:48 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20240130_br_titan/</guid><description>So I just finished reading the book Titan by Ron Chernow. This book was a total tomb! It took me close to a year to crawl through the whole book; I thought at one point that I was never going to finish reading the book! I first held a copy of the book years ago at a friend&amp;rsquo;s apartment and I was always fascinated to learn more about John D.</description></item><item><title>Documentary Review: The Commanding Heights (2002 Documentary)</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20231225_commanding_heights/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Dec 2023 21:53:38 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20231225_commanding_heights/</guid><description>I just finished watching a documentary series from 2002 called The Commanding Heights based on the book by Daniel Yergin and Joseph Stanislaw. This was a really interesting documentary series that I first learned about from an article on the personal finance website Investopedia. This documentary series is a three-part series that goes through the history of economics from it&amp;rsquo;s foundation to present day (i.e. the 21st century). Yes, the documentary is super dated because it came out in 2002; I could tell that it was pretty dated because of the music, the advertisements shown, and the people who were interviewed.</description></item><item><title>Airflow Documentation</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/engineering-posts/20231221_airflow_documentation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2023 18:31:53 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/engineering-posts/20231221_airflow_documentation/</guid><description>These notes are taken from the official Apache Airflow website Documentation section. Will possibly need to reference these notes later. &amp;ldquo;Apache Airflow is an open source platform for developing, scheduling, and monitoring batch-oriented workflows. Airflow’s extensible Python framework enables you to build workflows connecting with virtually any technology. A web interface helps manage the state of your workflows. Airflow is deployable in many ways, varying from a single process on your laptop to a distributed setup to support even the biggest workflows.</description></item></channel></rss>
