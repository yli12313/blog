I went to **Fête de la Musique** (World Music Day) at the French Embassy again this year. The party happened ~three months ago on Sat. 6/21/25 and I have to say it was pretty good again this year! There were lots of very interesting people present and it definitely had good vibes. The line to get into the embassy was a little rough, but I made it in after a long wait. Once I got in, the crowd was massive and it was definitely a bit overwhelming. I was lucky that my friend showed up later during the event, so at least I had one person there that I knew. We went around the venue and listened to different types of music; most of the musicians there were actually American and DMV local artists. That didn’t affect the vibes! When it got dark later into the night, that’s when the party really began. They brought out two DJs who played French house music; the techno/house music truly brought out the energy in everyone. People were dancing into the night under a very clear sky filled with stars. It was truly magical and definitely better than last year. This year I stayed until the very end and felt energized after the event ended. It was definitely super awesome and I would totally recommend it to anyone who likes to have a good time. Just look at the people in the video, FUN!! Life can be pretty cool sometimes!
