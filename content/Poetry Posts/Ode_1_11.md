**Ode 1.11 by Horace**

> You should not ask, it is unholy to know, for me or for you  
> what end the gods will have given, O Leuconoe, nor Babylonian  
> calculations attempt. Much better it is whatever will be to endure,  
> whether more winters Jupiter has allotted or the last,  
> which now weakens against opposing rocks the sea  
> Tyrrhenian: be wise, strain your wines, and because of brief life  
> cut short long-term hopes. While we are speaking, envious will have fled  
> a lifetime: seize the day, as little as possible trusting the future.  

Commentary: **Horace** was a leading poet during the reign of Roman emperor _Augustus Caesar_, who founded the Roman Empire. This poem is translated from latin and the latin for the english phrase "seize the day" (last sentence of the poem) is famously known to us as: _carpe diem_. This phrase was made famous in the movie _Dead Poets Society_, which drew inspiration from Ode 1.11. I like this poem because Horace offers some nice advice to Leuconoe: let the chips fall where they may; don't expect too much from the future, because today is all we have. Whatever happens, keep enduring.
