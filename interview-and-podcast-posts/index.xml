&lt;p>I listened to the whole 04:34:09 &lt;em>Lex Fridman Podcast&lt;/em> episode with &lt;strong>Pavel Durov&lt;/strong>, founder and CEO of the messaging app &lt;strong>Telegram&lt;/strong>. Telegram is one of the most widely used social media-instant messaging services in the world. Telegram is considered one of the most secure messaging services in terms of user privacy and user data security. I’ve used Telegram myself and have it installed on my own phone. I didn’t know much about Pavel Durov before this podcast episode, but I do remember last year (2024) he was arrested in France and that made international news. According to French authorities, Pavel was arrested for refusing to work with the police and the lack of content moderation on Telegram that allegedly led to criminal activities. I saw the news clippings for the arrest in France and then forgot about the story until I listened to this Lex Fridman Podcast episode.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jay Shetty Podcast Review: Emma Watson</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/interview-and-podcast-posts/20251012_emma_watson/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 16:21:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/interview-and-podcast-posts/20251012_emma_watson/</guid><description>&lt;div class="youtube-wrapper">

&lt;p>I listened to the whole 02:38:15 &lt;em>Jay Shetty Podcast&lt;/em> episode with &lt;strong>Emma Watson&lt;/strong> recently. I’m not the biggest fan of &lt;strong>Jay Shetty&lt;/strong> given that I don’t find him to be extremely wise or have really good insights. To be honest, he gives very obvious advice in my opinion; he seems more like a new-age guru who makes people feel good as opposed to having true wisdom or truly deep insights. With that said, I do give Jay credit in that he’s a good conversationalist and asks good questions. He does have lots of famous friends and is good at networking and growing his platform. This episode was very interesting because of who the guest was: &lt;strong>Emma Watson&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
