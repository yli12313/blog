I was interested in poetry as a young person, and that has carried over into adulthood. I was lucky enough that my teachers in elementary and middle school made us read poetry, and that has sparked an unending fascination with written words and literature to this day. To my surprise, I was so happy to learn that the Brave New Voices International Youth Poetry Slam (2024) was held in D.</description></item><item><title>Book Review: War Commentaries of Caesar</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/biography-posts/20240728_war_commentaries/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 12:18:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/biography-posts/20240728_war_commentaries/</guid><description>I try to read one biography or autobiography a year and I just finished reading the War Commentaries of Caesar, translated by Rex Warner. This book is the autobiographical account of Roman proconsul and general Julius Caesar, who has left us a first person account in great detail of his various military campaigns. The book is divided into two parts: 1) The Gallic Wars (58-50 BC) and 2) The Civil Wars (49-48 BC).</description></item><item><title>FÃºtbol with Spaniards ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ and Argentinians ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-posts/20240720_futbol/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2024 12:15:52 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-posts/20240720_futbol/</guid><description>Last weekend I went to watch the UEFA Euro Championship 2024 final at Wunder Garten and Copa AmÃ©rica 2024 final (unexpectedly) at Lunas de Buenos Aires. I will discuss both events in detail. Soccer (or football to the world) was my first sport and my first love. Itâ€™s been years since Iâ€™ve played or watched soccer, probably close to 10 years. However, I want to get back into following the sport and possibly even play again.</description></item><item><title>Summer SoirÃ©e at the French Embassy! ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-posts/20240702_french_embassy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 22:54:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-posts/20240702_french_embassy/</guid><description>So I recently went to FÃªte de la Musique (World Music Day) at the French Embassy in Georgetown, Washington D.C. I went with a friend and had no idea what to expect! I almost didnâ€™t go because I had no idea what kind of music they were going to play at the event. All I knew was that there was no entrance fee, which is a rarity for an embassy event.</description></item><item><title>Conference Review: PyCon US 2024 (Pittsburgh)</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-posts/20240606_pycon/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2024 16:14:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-posts/20240606_pycon/</guid><description>This was the first time I attended PyCon. I was originally slated to go to PyCon in the year 2020 also in Pittsburgh, but the pandemic disrupted the conference (I had the hotel and conference ticket booked at the time). I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to attend PyCon and have been a Python user since I was 18. At PyCon, I was most surprised by the amount of people from all over the world who are Python developers!</description></item><item><title>Book Review: Basic Economics</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20240507_br_basic_economics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2024 21:55:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20240507_br_basic_economics/</guid><description>This is a long overdue blog post about the book Basic Economics; A Citizenâ€™s Guide to the Economy written by Dr. Thomas Sowell. Dr. Sowell is a world-renowned economist who has had an amazing academic career. He is a proponent of the Chicago School of Economics, which is a neoclassical school of thought that has full confidence in a free market, price-coordinated economy. This was honestly an eye-opening book that has a vast amount of knowledge if one were to read the book carefully.</description></item><item><title>Book Review: A Random Walk Down Wall St.</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20240316_br_a_random_walk_down_wall_st/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2024 22:52:38 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20240316_br_a_random_walk_down_wall_st/</guid><description>I just finished reading the classic book on personal finance and investing, A Random Walk Down Wall St. written by Dr. Burton Malkiel (Professor Emeritus at Princeton U. Economics). It&amp;rsquo;s been said that Dr. Malkiel has the common sense of Benjamin Franklin, the academic/institutional knowledge of Dr. Milton Friedman and the practical experience of Warren Buffett. His investment advice is considered by the Wall St. Journal to be &amp;ldquo;the best and latest investment advice money can buy.</description></item><item><title>Volunteering at McKinley Technology High School</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-posts/20240130_volunteering_mths/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 18:11:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-posts/20240130_volunteering_mths/</guid><description>Update (Sat. 3/17/24 @ 1:48 AM EST): Iâ€™m writing to give an update on my experiences volunteering at McKinley Technology High School in NE, Washington D.C. Iâ€™m also attaching a more recent picture of the robot! It is now a fully functioning robot. Overall itâ€™s been a great experience and Iâ€™ve learned so much from the students. I would 100% become a volunteer again (if time avails). Iâ€™ve tried to add value to what the studentâ€™s have been doing with the robot.</description></item><item><title>Book Review: Titan</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20240130_br_titan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 16:59:48 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20240130_br_titan/</guid><description>So I just finished reading the book Titan by Ron Chernow. This book was a total tomb! It took me close to a year to crawl through the whole book; I thought at one point that I was never going to finish reading the book! I first held a copy of the book years ago at a friend&amp;rsquo;s apartment and I was always fascinated to learn more about John D.</description></item><item><title>Documentary Review: The Commanding Heights (2002 Documentary)</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20231225_commanding_heights/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Dec 2023 21:53:38 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20231225_commanding_heights/</guid><description>I just finished watching a documentary series from 2002 called The Commanding Heights based on the book by Daniel Yergin and Joseph Stanislaw. This was a really interesting documentary series that I first learned about from an article on the personal finance website Investopedia. This documentary series is a three-part series that goes through the history of economics from it&amp;rsquo;s foundation to present day (i.e. the 21st century). Yes, the documentary is super dated because it came out in 2002; I could tell that it was pretty dated because of the music, the advertisements shown, and the people who were interviewed.</description></item></channel></rss>
