&lt;em>Hacking with my team along with some Maryland Terps seated right next to us!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This event happened a couple months ago (&lt;em>Sat. 3/29/25&lt;/em>) and it was certainly very cool, so I don’t want to forget about it. I saw that the &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.scsp.ai/">Special Competitive Studies Project&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> was going to host its second hackathon in Crystal City, Virginia. This was a one-day hackathon with a total prize pool of $50K. That’s a lot of money for a one day hackathon! For those who are unfamiliar, SCSP.ai is the brainchild of former Google Chairmen/CEO Eric Schmidt. The organization’s goal is to study and make policy recommendations on how to stay competitive with respect to Artificial Intelligence (AI). We all know that AI technology is one of the bedrocks of currently ongoing great powers competition among nation-states. I didn’t end up going to the first hackathon last year because I didn’t know about it, but I learned about this second hackathon from my friend. He went to the first one and said it was very fancy and very well done. I wanted to see for myself what SCSP.ai’s hackathons were really like. I didn’t know what to expect, but I decided to just sign up and show up. Sometimes that’s the key to everything, you know? &lt;strong>Have a nose for opportunity and just show up when others are not willing to&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Volunteering at George Hacks</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250423_george_hacks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 16:29:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250423_george_hacks/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250423_George_Hacks/george_hacks.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This event happened around ~1.5 months ago and I’m only blogging about it now. I decided to become a mentor at &lt;strong>George Hacks&lt;/strong>, which is a student-led innovation hackathon at &lt;strong>George Washington University&lt;/strong> (GWU). I saw an event notice saying they were looking for mentors on a public Slack channel. I felt like I could give good advice to some of the student teams and help them brainstorm solutions. I did it with the intention of making a difference and the mindset to help and to serve. I wanted to represent the organizers of the hackathon with honor and integrity most of all! I had no idea what to expect when I signed up as a mentor, but I’m very glad that I did it looking back.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
