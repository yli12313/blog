I was given the opportunity by my friend to be a keynote speaker for the **Data Engineering D.C.** (**DEDC**) Meetup on Wed. 8/27/25, which was right after I officially joined **Data Community D.C.** (**DC2**) as a volunteer. I joined as a DC2 volunteer because I previously had ~3 years of experience organizing **Data Science Philadelphia** (**DataPhilly**). I learned a lot from my experience working for DataPhilly and wanted to continue making a difference and helping people in the data community. I felt that I could bring energy to some of the meetups in the D.C. area and was bidding my time to find the right opportunity. DEDC was restarted in 2025 and had good momentum going, hosting events once every month from January - May (of which many I attended). After May, I felt perhaps the momentum was waning and the group needed some energy; therefore, I contacted my friend Will Angel to not only be a speaker, but also a volunteer for the group and the rest was history. 

We started talking over the summer and agreed that our first event would be an event on AI tools in August, 2025. The organizers of DEDC would be keynotes speakers for this event, and I was allotted ~30 minutes to speak. Because I work in the space sector, I wanted to inspire the audience and do something memorable. I did a lot of research and decided to present a project on exoplanets and the TESS Satellite, which is a mission that I supported; I also took a class from Anthropic Academy on Claude Code, which is an agentic coding tool. Thereafter, I was able to marry the two topics and create a totally unique data pipeline project. I used the exoplanets API library (CalTech) and built a Claude Code technical project that helped the general public understand astrophysics (specifically exoplanets exploration). I worked really, really hard on this talk; it took me a couple of weeks to prepare the talk, probably close to a month. The most important thing to me was: inspire people and give them wonder and hope. I tried to do that by bringing high energy, passion, and personality to the talk, such that the talk would be unlike any other talk they’ve seen and heard before. The talk was very well received and multiple people told me they really enjoyed it. I received a lot of LinkedIn invitations after this talk! This goes to show the importance of: **having a nose for opportunity and taking full advantage of every opportunity you get to the maximum**.

The DEDC team was able to put out two other high quality events after August to end the year 2025. We are really proud of the work that we did and we are really excited about what we will do in 2026! It was a fantastic job by the team to maintain the momentum and we are so happy there’s a community that loves data engineering in D.C. I remain committed to being a DC2 organizer and look forward to giving it my all in 2026, that I can promise you. **I’m not going to stop grinding, I’m going to keep pushing harder because I know that what I’m doing is making a true difference**.
