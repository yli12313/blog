I last volunteered for RESET from Fall,2019 - Spring,2022. In previous volunteering opportunities, I was always working with middle school students teaching Scratch (which is a programming language that is geared towards middle school students to get them interested in coding), but this year I’m working with high school students on a robotics competition at McKinley Technology High School in NE, Washington D.</description></item><item><title>Book Review: Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20240130_br_titan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 16:59:48 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20240130_br_titan/</guid><description>So I just finished reading the book Titan by Ron Chernow.

This was a really interesting documentary series that I first learned about from an article on the personal finance website Investopedia. This documentary series is a three-part series that goes through the history of economics from it&amp;rsquo;s foundation to present day (i.e. the 21st century). Yes, the documentary is super dated because it came out in 2002; I could tell that it was pretty dated because of the music, the advertisements shown, and the people who were interviewed.</description></item><item><title>Airflow Documentation</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/engineering-posts/20231221_airflow_documentation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2023 18:31:53 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/engineering-posts/20231221_airflow_documentation/</guid><description>These notes are taken from the official Apache Airflow website Documentation section. Will possibly need to reference these notes later. &amp;ldquo;Apache Airflow is an open source platform for developing, scheduling, and monitoring batch-oriented workflows.
