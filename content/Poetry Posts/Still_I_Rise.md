**Still I Rise by Maya Angelou**

> You may write me down in history   
> With your bitter, twisted lies,  
> You may trod me in the very dirt  
> But still, like dust, I’ll rise.  
>
> Does my sassiness upset you?  
> Why are you beset with gloom?  
> ’Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells  
> Pumping in my living room.  
> Just like moons and like suns,  
> With the certainty of tides,  
> Just like hopes springing high,  
> Still I’ll rise.  
>
> Did you want to see me broken?  
> Bowed head and lowered eyes?  
> Shoulders falling down like teardrops,  
> Weakened by my soulful cries?  
>
> Does my haughtiness offend you?  
> Don’t you take it awful hard  
> ’Cause I laugh like I’ve got gold mines  
> Diggin’ in my own backyard.  
>
> You may shoot me with your words,  
> You may cut me with your eyes,  
> You may kill me with your hatefulness,  
> But still, like air, I’ll rise.  
>
> Does my sexiness upset you?  
> Does it come as a surprise  
> That I dance like I’ve got diamonds  
> At the meeting of my thighs?  
> 
> Out of the huts of history’s shame  
> I rise  
> Up from a past that’s rooted in pain  
> I rise  
> I’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,  
> Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.  
>
> Leaving behind nights of terror and fear  
> I rise  
> Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear  
> I rise  
> Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,  
> I am the dream and the hope of the slave.  
> I rise  
> I rise  
> I rise.  

Commentary: **Maya Angelou** is someone that I'm awe of. She passed away in 2014, but her legacy lives on forever. *Still I Rise* is in my top five poems I've ever read, and has gotten me through some very difficult times. It's easily the best American poem ever written. I resonate with the poem because I also know what it feels like to be counted out, ignored, and hated on. But that's ok. The hate is actually love and always makes me stronger. I love challenges! For people who deal with baggage, trauma, stress, bias, and things not going according to plan, this poem is for you. The human spirit to **keep fighting** is stronger than any negative force out there. With faith, a person can overcome any kind of situation (good, bad, or indifferent). Believe it and rise above the situation; good things will happen sooner or later!
