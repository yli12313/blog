&lt;p>&lt;strong>O Me! O Life! by Walt Whitman&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh me! Oh life! of the questions of these recurring,&lt;br>
Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish,&lt;br>
Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)&lt;br>
Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,&lt;br>
Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,&lt;br>
Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,&lt;br>
The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Poem Review: Ozymandias</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/poetry-posts/ozymandias/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 00:43:57 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/poetry-posts/ozymandias/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250629_Poets/ozymandias.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Ozymandias by Percy Bysshe Shelley&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I met a traveller from an antique land,&lt;br>
Who said — “Two vast and trunkless legs of stone&lt;br>
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,&lt;br>
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,&lt;br>
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,&lt;br>
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read&lt;br>
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,&lt;br>
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;&lt;br>
And on the pedestal, these words appear:&lt;br>
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;&lt;br>
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!&lt;br>
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay&lt;br>
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare&lt;br>
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Poem Review: Still I Rise</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/poetry-posts/still_i_rise/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:57:33 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/poetry-posts/still_i_rise/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250629_Poets/maya_angelou.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Still I Rise by Maya Angelou&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You may write me down in history&lt;br>
With your bitter, twisted lies,&lt;br>
You may trod me in the very dirt&lt;br>
But still, like dust, I’ll rise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Does my sassiness upset you?&lt;br>
Why are you beset with gloom?&lt;br>
’Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells&lt;br>
Pumping in my living room.&lt;br>
Just like moons and like suns,&lt;br>
With the certainty of tides,&lt;br>
Just like hopes springing high,&lt;br>
Still I’ll rise.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Poem Review: Ode 1.11</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/poetry-posts/ode_1_11/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 23:02:05 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/poetry-posts/ode_1_11/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250629_Poets/horace.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Ode 1.11 by Horace&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You should not ask, it is unholy to know, for me or for you&lt;br>
what end the gods will have given, O Leuconoe, nor Babylonian&lt;br>
calculations attempt. Much better it is whatever will be to endure,&lt;br>
whether more winters Jupiter has allotted or the last,&lt;br>
which now weakens against opposing rocks the sea&lt;br>
Tyrrhenian: be wise, strain your wines, and because of brief life&lt;br>
cut short long-term hopes. While we are speaking, envious will have fled&lt;br>
a lifetime: seize the day, as little as possible trusting the future.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
