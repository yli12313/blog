&lt;p>I went to &lt;strong>Fête de la Musique&lt;/strong> (World Music Day) at the French Embassy again this year. The party happened ~three months ago on Sat. 6/21/25 and I have to say it was pretty good again this year! There were lots of very interesting people there and definitely it had good vibes. The line to get into the embassy was a little rough, but I made it in again this year. Once I got in, the crowd was massive and it was definitely a bit overwhelming. I was lucky that my friend showed up later during the event too, so I at least had one person there that I knew. We went around the venue and listened to different types of music, where most of the musicians there were actually American and DMV local artists. That didn’t affect the vibes! Then when it got dark into the night, that’s when the party really began. They brought out two DJs who played French house music; that’s when the party really started. People were dancing into the night under a clear sky filled with stars. It was truly magical and definitely better than last year. This year I stayed until the very end and felt energized after the end of the event. It was definitely super awesome and I would totally recommend it to anyone who likes to have a good time. Just look at the people in the video, FUN!! Partying in the summer is a good way to enjoy life!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Documentary Review: Empires - Napoleon</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/autobiography-and-biography-posts/20250830_dr_napoleon/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 23:02:22 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/autobiography-and-biography-posts/20250830_dr_napoleon/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250830_DR_Napoleon/napoleon.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really enjoyed the four-part mini-series &lt;strong>Empires - Napoleon&lt;/strong> from PBS (2000). It’s a pretty old documentary mini-series, but it was certainly very interesting. The documentary tells the whole life story of former French Emperor and General &lt;strong>Napoleon Bonaparte&lt;/strong>. Napoleon is an interesting guy and I’ve previously watched two movies on the guy: Napoleon (Ridley Scott; 2023) and Waterloo (Sergei Bondarchuk; 1970). I was not the biggest fan of the Ridley Scott film Napoleon, but Waterloo was an interesting film. I wanted to write a blog for the Napoleon documentary because this was an exceptionally well-made documentary that had some very interesting content.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI Expo Hackathon</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250830_ai_expo_hackathon/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 17:27:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250830_ai_expo_hackathon/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250830_AI_Expo_Hackathon/hackathon.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This event happened back in June (Mon. 6/2/25 - Wed. 6/4/25) and it was a pretty cool event! I was invited to a national AI hackathon sponsored by OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic and AGI House. The hackathon was happening in conjunction with the SCSP AI+ Expo at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington D.C. I was encouraged by multiple people from AGI House to apply to the hackathon and thankfully I got in! I was extremely excited to go to the event given the excellent hackathon I went to earlier this year, also sponsored by SCSP and AGI House. The AI Expo happened last year too, but I was not able to go. Therefore I was equally excited to go to the Expo myself and check out some of the vendors there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Personal Thought: On Finding a Passion</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/personal-thought-posts/20250817_pt_passion/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 01:49:39 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/personal-thought-posts/20250817_pt_passion/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a topic that I have strong opinions on and it’s something that I’ve ruminated and experimented with for the past ~10 years. I’m not an expert, but I do have some insights as to how this works. One of my biggest fears when I was younger was always this: I was deeply fearful I would not find something that I would be deeply passionate about by the time I turned 30. My worst nightmare would have been doing a job that I had absolutely no passion for; to just go through the motions everyday seemed like a complete nightmare to me. This one fear pervaded my mind for many, many years. I knew who I wanted to be and I was inspired by people who derive great joy in what they do. You notice the difference: the people who love what they do are willing to sacrifice pretty much everything to make their dreams come true. They bring high energy to what they do each and every day. You can feel it, see it, and smell it. I thought given that we spend most of our lives working, it would be totally foolish not to find what my calling was.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Personal Thought: On Failing</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/personal-thought-posts/20250802_pt_failing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 11:51:46 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/personal-thought-posts/20250802_pt_failing/</guid><description>&lt;p>It sucks when you try things and they don’t work out. Just super frustrating when you do things and they don’t turn out to be what you expect or you can’t get it to work. I tried to build three different projects in my spare time this year and none have turned out the way that I thought they would. I just felt like the output was not good enough, so I decided to archive each project and move on to new projects. It’s always exciting to start something new; the beginning is so fun! And then you hit turbulence and roadblocks. You try, try, try and then realize the &lt;strong>sunk-cost fallacy&lt;/strong> is way too overwhelming to continue. You abandon the project in the middle and it never really finishes or is in a state that makes it presentable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Conference Review: PyCon US 2025 (Pittsburgh)</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250719_pycon/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2025 20:01:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250719_pycon/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250719_PyCon/pycon.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went to &lt;strong>PyCon&lt;/strong> (Fri. 5/16/25 - Sun. 5/18/25) again this year. The more I write, the more I realize how incredible my PyCon 2025 experience really was. This is the second year in a row that I went to PyCon and it was lovely overall because the conference was held in Pittsburgh again. Pittsburgh is only a five-hour drive from where I live, so there was no way that I was going to miss PyCon. Next year it will be held in Long Beach, CA and I’m not sure if I will be able to go. Therefore, I had to make the most of this opportunity. I stayed with a friend in North Oakland right near Carnegie Mellon U., which is a really nice school with a fantastic campus. Loved walking around the campus, which was very modern. Moreover my ticket was paid for by my work, so overall it was very cost-effective for me to go.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Poem Review: Ozymandias</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/poetry-posts/ozymandias/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 00:43:57 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/poetry-posts/ozymandias/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250629_Poets/ozymandias.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Ozymandias by Percy Bysshe Shelley&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I met a traveller from an antique land,&lt;br>
Who said — “Two vast and trunkless legs of stone&lt;br>
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,&lt;br>
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,&lt;br>
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,&lt;br>
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read&lt;br>
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,&lt;br>
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;&lt;br>
And on the pedestal, these words appear:&lt;br>
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;&lt;br>
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!&lt;br>
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay&lt;br>
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare&lt;br>
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Poem Review: Still I Rise</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/poetry-posts/still_i_rise/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:57:33 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/poetry-posts/still_i_rise/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250629_Poets/maya_angelou.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You may write me down in history&lt;br>
With your bitter, twisted lies,&lt;br>
You may trod me in the very dirt&lt;br>
But still, like dust, I’ll rise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Does my sassiness upset you?&lt;br>
Why are you beset with gloom?&lt;br>
’Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells&lt;br>
Pumping in my living room.&lt;br>
Just like moons and like suns,&lt;br>
With the certainty of tides,&lt;br>
Just like hopes springing high,&lt;br>
Still I’ll rise.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Poem Review: Ode 1.11</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/poetry-posts/ode_1_11/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 23:02:05 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/poetry-posts/ode_1_11/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250629_Poets/horace.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Ode 1.11 by Horace&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You should not ask, it is unholy to know, for me or for you&lt;br>
what end the gods will have given, O Leuconoe, nor Babylonian&lt;br>
calculations attempt. Much better it is whatever will be to endure,&lt;br>
whether more winters Jupiter has allotted or the last,&lt;br>
which now weakens against opposing rocks the sea&lt;br>
Tyrrhenian: be wise, strain your wines, and because of brief life&lt;br>
cut short long-term hopes. While we are speaking, envious will have fled&lt;br>
a lifetime: seize the day, as little as possible trusting the future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book Review: How to Talk to Anyone</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/social-science-posts/20250628_br_talk_to_anyone/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 16:25:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/social-science-posts/20250628_br_talk_to_anyone/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250628_BR_Talk_To_Anyone/cover.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just finished reading &lt;strong>How to Talk to Anyone - 92 Little Tricks for Big Success in Relationships&lt;/strong> by &lt;strong>Leil Lowndes&lt;/strong>. This is a fantastic book that teaches one how to approach business networking as both a science and an art. This book has some true gems when it comes to what to say and do in work, business, and other social settings. The author Leil Lowndes clearly has years of experience when it comes to wielding a strong social game and she has great wisdom. I’ve been to countless meetups, conferences, talks, company events, and business soirées in the past 10 years and thought of myself as a strong networker. I realized from reading this book that there’s another level and I’ve gained new insights that I never thought of before. I’ve gained new ideas and new things to try out next time and I believe these new skills will take my networking abilities to the next level. What I appreciated most about this book is that it’s very practical in nature. A lot of the ideas you can implement right away. Therefore, I’m going to share the five tricks that I found most insightful from a truly excellent book!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hubble Space Telescope: 35-Year Celebration</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250622_hubble/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2025 19:22:13 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250622_hubble/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250622_Hubble/hubble.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of a work perk, I was invited to the &lt;strong>Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/strong> 35-year celebration at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland, located on the campus of Johns Hopkins University (JHU). This was a surprising treat for me because I didn’t anticipate receiving an invitation to this event. As someone relatively new to the institute, this invite-only event was more for senior-level people, but I somehow received an invite. There was no way I was going to miss it! I drove up to Baltimore that day (Thu. 4/24/25) feeling very good. It was definitely very special and a unique honor for me, given that I grew up with the Hubble.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI Agents for Defense and Gov.

&lt;em>Hacking with my team along with some Maryland Terps seated right next to us!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This event happened a couple months ago (Sat. 3/29/25) and it was certainly very cool, so I don’t want to forget about it. I saw that the &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.scsp.ai/">Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP)&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> was going to host its second hackathon in Crystal City, Virginia. This was a one-day hackathon with a total prize pool of $50K. That’s a lot of money for a one day hackathon! For those who are unfamiliar, SCSP.ai is the brainchild of former Google Chairman/CEO Eric Schmidt. The organization’s goal is to study and make policy recommendations on how to stay competitive with respect to artificial intelligence (AI). We all know that AI technology is one of the bedrocks of currently ongoing great powers competition among nation-states. I didn’t end up going to the first hackathon last year because I didn’t know about it, but I learned about this second hackathon from my friend. He went to the first one and said it was very fancy and very well done. I wanted to see for myself what SCSP.ai’s hackathons were really like. I didn’t know what to expect, but I decided to just sign up and show up. Sometimes that’s the key to everything, you know? &lt;strong>Have a nose for opportunity and just show up when others are not willing to&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Volunteering at George Hacks</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250423_george_hacks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 16:29:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2025-posts/20250423_george_hacks/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250423_George_Hacks/george_hacks.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This event happened around ~1.5 months ago (Sat. 3/1/25 - Sun. 3/2/25) and I’m only blogging about it now. I decided to become a mentor at &lt;strong>George Hacks&lt;/strong>, which is a student-led innovation hackathon at &lt;strong>George Washington University&lt;/strong> (GWU). I saw an event notice saying they were looking for mentors on a public Slack channel. I felt like I could give good advice to some of the student teams and help them brainstorm solutions. I did it with the intention of making a difference and the mindset to help and to serve. I wanted to represent the organizers of the hackathon with honor and integrity most of all! I had no idea what to expect when I signed up as a mentor, but I’m very glad that I did it looking back.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book Review: Meditations - Marcus Aurelius</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/autobiography-and-biography-posts/20250412_meditations/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 15:38:16 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/autobiography-and-biography-posts/20250412_meditations/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20250412_BR_Meditations/cover.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I finished reading my first book of the year! I finished reading &lt;strong>Meditations&lt;/strong> by Emperor &lt;strong>Marcus Aurelius&lt;/strong>, who was Emperor of Rome from 161-180 AD. This is a famous book that I’ve heard about for many years, but I had never taken the time to actually read it carefully until this year. In a way, this book has influenced me for decades now because it’s the inspiration for the two Ridley Scott films: &lt;strong>Gladiator&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Gladiator II&lt;/strong>. &lt;em>Gladiator&lt;/em> is one of my favorite movies ever and I must have watched the movie more than five times! &lt;em>Gladiator II&lt;/em> came out more recently in 2024, and it was ok. It was never going to be as good as the original, no matter what they did. I, along with many other guys, love the movie &lt;em>Gladiator&lt;/em> because I love the way the protagonist &lt;strong>Maximus Decimus Meridius&lt;/strong> dealt with adversity, kept fighting, and never gave up, even when all hope seemed lost. The movie was a fictional account of real events and people, but it was so vivid and well done that it brought to life the Stoic principles and Stoicism advocated by Emperor Marcus Aurelius. I just knew I had to read &lt;strong>Meditations&lt;/strong> and made an earnest effort to read it starting last year. It was a very challenging read and I found a good translation of the book from late 19th century London, U.K. The English phrases and vernacular are not written in a way that’s common today, so I had to spend time carefully parsing the meaning of passages, as well as use Claude.ai to help me understand super challenging passages. Nevertheless, I finished reading the book and there is so much WISDOM in the book from a truly deep thinker! Some of the ideas are super practical in our day-to-day lives. Here are my five favorite quotes about Stoicism from the &lt;strong>Meditations&lt;/strong> of Emperor &lt;em>Marcus Aurelius&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaking at The AI Summit New York</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2024-posts/20241224_nyc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2024 23:57:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2024-posts/20241224_nyc/</guid><description>&lt;p>What a way to end a crazy year: presenting a keynote talk at The AI Summit New York 2024! I never expected to be a speaker at The AI Summit New York, but it happened. I submitted an abstract on a whim and truth be told, never expected to hear anything back. But I did hear back from the conference organizers who liked my abstract and wanted me to come to New York City (NYC) and give my talk in December! This was a dream come true for me. I had wanted to attend or speak at a conference in NYC for many years now; I just never expected it to happen this year. This just goes to show that life happens in the most unexpected ways. &lt;strong>We can never really predict how things will turn out, but things happen the more chances we take&lt;/strong>. I’m going to write about how the conference was and then I’m going to write about what I thought about NYC having last been in Manhattan seven years ago. It was very stressful preparing a presentation, making the arrangements to travel up to NYC, going to the conference + giving the presentation, and then traveling home. But I am very glad that I did it and it was a great learning experience for me overall. It&amp;rsquo;s always a good idea to take stretch opportunities and try bigger challenges.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book Review: The Coming Wave</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/engineering-posts/20241215_br_the_coming_wave/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2024 17:11:27 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/engineering-posts/20241215_br_the_coming_wave/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20241215_BR_The_Coming_Wave/cover.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just finished reading &lt;strong>Mustafa Suleyman&lt;/strong>’s book &lt;em>The Coming Wave&lt;/em>. This book I got for free at The Atlantic Festival 2023. My friend told me about the festival last year and I was unsure if going to this event was worth my time or not. But because I had just finished my M.S. degree and was technically still classified as a student, I was able to get the student discount for I think $23. This was a total steal and a great deal, so I thought why not? Why not go to The Atlantic Festival and see what happens? One of the sessions I attended was a panel discussion with supermodel Karlie Kloss and Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of DeepMind, Infection AI and author of this book; interestingly Mustafa is now at Microsoft and works for Microsoft AI. To be honest, I don’t remember much from their panel discussion. I remember the panel discussion was around noon time and I fell asleep during parts of the discussion. At the end of the discussion, they gave everyone a free copy of Mustafa’s latest book &lt;em>The Coming Wave&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Space Expoloration Adventures (Fall, 2024)</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2024-posts/20241025_space_adventures/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2024 01:03:36 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2024-posts/20241025_space_adventures/</guid><description>&lt;p>These are some of the cool space exploration events I went to recently.

&lt;p>As part of a work perk, I was invited to tour NASA Goddard again after International Observe the Moon Night a week earlier. This time, it was an actual tour of the Hubble Space Telescope mission operations center (MOC) and Roman clean room. I was most excited to see the Roman clean room because this is where the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope assembly is taking place. The Roman Space Telescope is the next-generation space telescope in infrared slated for launch in summer, 2027. It’s more powerful than either the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) or the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), with a field of view 100x bigger than JWST and 200x bigger than HST. Let me talk about both experiences in detail: first the HST MOC visit and then the Roman clean room visit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hosting My First Panel Discussion (Meetup)</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2024-posts/20240927_hosting_a_meetup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 23:17:48 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2024-posts/20240927_hosting_a_meetup/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20240927_Hosting_A_Meetup/meetup.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really enjoyed helping host the &lt;em>Launching a Data Science Career&lt;/em> 🚀 panel discussion in collaboration with the &lt;strong>Bethesda Data Science&lt;/strong> meetup. It was a good meetup that the team hoped would help people with navigating their careers at the entry-level, mid-level and director level. I just felt that with the current economy the way that it is, there’s so much negativity and hopelessness. There are so many people who are hurting right now due to the fact that they can’t find employment. I, along with the Bethesda Data Science team, wanted to do something about it. We wanted to let people know that there are others out there that care about them. We wanted to give people the chance to ask questions and have their questions answered with specifics. We wanted to give people practical tips that they could implement right away. We don’t know if this meetup helped people at all, but we did everything that we could to put out a meetup worthy of peoples’ time and respect. We prepared questions in advance, had the panelists prepare answers in advance, and there was a lot of communication to make sure the event was a success. There was a high RSVP number and we expected a big turnout. However, around one hour before the event, there was inclement weather in the form of a thunderstorm. The thunderstorm turned out to be not that serious, but it dampened the audience turnout. But hey, it happens! The show must go on, and it did. We ended up doing the meetup and it was a total success. Thanks to the panelists for speaking and &lt;strong>Applied Photons&lt;/strong> for hosting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book Review: Elon Musk</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/engineering-posts/20240902_br_elon_musk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 22:41:10 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/engineering-posts/20240902_br_elon_musk/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20240902_BR_Elon_Musk/cover.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“Adversity shaped me,” he (Musk) says. “My pain threshold become very high.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So I just finished reading the Walter Isaacson biography: &lt;em>Elon Musk&lt;/em>. My honest review of the book is that it’s ok. It’s not bad, not good; it’s average and I rate it 2.5/5. I first read Ashlee Vance’s book: &lt;em>Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future&lt;/em> back in 2015, and that was absolutely fantastic. Back then ~10 years ago, there was not that much known about Elon Musk or his background and work thus far. Elon was still kind of a mystery, and not the same Elon Musk that we know today. The Walter Isaacson book goes over Elon’s journey from childhood in South Africa to the end of 2022, when he bought Twitter and rebranded it as X.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Brave New Voices International Youth Poetry Slam (Finals, 2024)</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2024-posts/20240810_brave_new_voices/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Aug 2024 08:23:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2024-posts/20240810_brave_new_voices/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20240810_Brave_New_Voices/brave_new_voices.jpg" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve been a fan of poetry for many years now. I was interested in poetry as a young person, and that has carried over into adulthood. I was lucky enough that my teachers in elementary and middle school made us read poetry, and that has sparked an unending fascination with written words and literature to this day. To my surprise, I was so happy to learn that the &lt;strong>Brave New Voices International Youth Poetry Slam (2024)&lt;/strong> was held in D.C. this year! I immediately got a ticket and just knew that I had to be there in-person at the competition finals. Brave New Voices is a nonprofit organization that promotes spoken word poetry, also known as slam poetry for middle school and high school students. It is electric, passionate, and a true art. The poem that I saw ~10 years ago that introduced me to Brave New Voices was a poem called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0QiFy8dmX0&amp;amp;t=61s">&lt;strong>Thinking About You&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> (click to view). It is still one of the most creative, unique, and unforgettable poems I have EVER HEARD! I wanted to go to the competition finals to get a better understanding of young people these days and the problems that affect them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book Review: War Commentaries of Caesar</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/autobiography-and-biography-posts/20240728_war_commentaries/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 12:18:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/autobiography-and-biography-posts/20240728_war_commentaries/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20240728_BR_War_Commentaries/cover.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I try to read one biography or autobiography a year and I just finished reading the &lt;strong>War Commentaries of Caesar&lt;/strong>, translated by &lt;em>Rex Warner&lt;/em>. This book is the autobiographical account of Roman proconsul and general &lt;strong>Julius Caesar&lt;/strong>, who has left us a first person account in great detail of his various military campaigns. The book is divided into two parts: &lt;strong>1)&lt;/strong> &lt;em>The Gallic Wars&lt;/em> (58-50 BC) and &lt;strong>2)&lt;/strong> &lt;em>The Civil Wars&lt;/em> (49-48 BC). Here’s a quick summary of the book: Caesar was able to take Gaul (present day France) and Britanni (present day U.K.) after much struggle, and was lauded as a hero back in Rome at the conclusion of the Gallic Wars. However disagreements with the Roman Senate and his once friend Pompey resulted in a bloody civil war where Romans were fighting other Romans around present day southern France, Spain, and North Africa. Pompey et al. subsequently lost the civil wars and Caesar appointed himself dictator, administered elections as a dictator, and thus changed the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. Lesson learned: as much as people are lauded for their strengths and achievements, they also inevitably have weaknesses too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fútbol with Spaniards 🇪🇸 and Argentinians 🇦🇷</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2024-posts/20240720_futbol/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2024 12:15:52 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2024-posts/20240720_futbol/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last weekend I went to watch the &lt;em>UEFA Euro Championship 2024&lt;/em> final at Wunder Garten and &lt;em>Copa América 2024&lt;/em> final (unexpectedly) at Lunas de Buenos Aires. I will discuss both events in detail. Soccer (or football to the world) was my first sport and my first love. It’s been years since I’ve played or watched soccer, probably close to 10 years. However, I want to get back into following the sport and possibly even play again. It’s a good way to stay fit and active. Here’s what happened last Sunday (7/14/24) given that there were two major tournament finals happening at the same time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Summer Soirée at the French Embassy! 🇫🇷</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2024-posts/20240702_french_embassy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 22:54:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2024-posts/20240702_french_embassy/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20240702_French_Embassy/party.jpg" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I recently went to &lt;strong>Fête de la Musique&lt;/strong> (World Music Day) at the French Embassy in Georgetown, Washington D.C. I went with a friend and had no idea what to expect! I almost didn’t go because I had no idea what kind of music they were going to play at the event. All I knew was that there was no entrance fee, which is a rarity for an embassy event. To be honest, this was the main driving force behind why I wanted to go: it was free and I had never been to the French Embassy before.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Conference Review: PyCon US 2024 (Pittsburgh)</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2024-posts/20240606_pycon/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2024 16:14:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2024-posts/20240606_pycon/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20240606_PyCon/standing.jpg" alt="p1">

&lt;p>This was the first time I attended PyCon. I was originally slated to go to PyCon in the year 2020 also in Pittsburgh, but the pandemic disrupted the conference (I had the hotel and conference ticket booked at the time). I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to attend PyCon and have been a Python user since I was 18. At PyCon, I was most surprised by the amount of people from all over the world who are Python developers! For example I met developers from Norway and Zimbabwe, which are two countries that I’ve never met people from. I really enjoyed some of the talks and some of the notable ones that stood out to me were:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book Review: Basic Economics</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20240507_br_basic_economics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2024 21:55:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20240507_br_basic_economics/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20240507_BR_Basic_Economics/cover.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a long overdue blog post about the book &lt;strong>Basic Economics; A Citizen’s Guide to the Economy&lt;/strong> written by &lt;em>Dr. Thomas Sowell&lt;/em>. Dr. Sowell is a world-renowned economist who has had an amazing academic career. He is a proponent of the Chicago School of Economics, which is a &lt;strong>neoclassical school&lt;/strong> of thought that has full confidence in a free market, price-coordinated economy. This was honestly an eye-opening book that has a vast amount of knowledge if one were to read the book carefully. The book is pretty high-level and conceptual, but the implications are practical in nature (i.e. you can actually apply some of the theory in real life). The book really lifts the lid on how capitalism works under the hood, both its virtues and its flaws. No system is perfect, but Dr. Sowell argues that the free market system will always be better than any other system. Here are the top five lessons that I learned from &lt;strong>Basic Economics&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book Review: A Random Walk Down Wall St.</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20240316_br_a_random_walk_down_wall_st/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2024 22:52:38 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20240316_br_a_random_walk_down_wall_st/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20240317_BR_A_Random_Down_Wall_St/cover.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I just finished reading the classic book on personal finance and investing, &lt;strong>A Random Walk Down Wall St.&lt;/strong> written by &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burton_Malkiel">Dr. Burton Malkiel&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> (Professor Emeritus at Princeton U. Economics). It&amp;rsquo;s been said that Dr. Malkiel has the common sense of &lt;em>Benjamin Franklin&lt;/em>, the academic/institutional knowledge of &lt;em>Dr. Milton Friedman&lt;/em> and the practical experience of &lt;em>Warren Buffett&lt;/em>. His investment advice is considered by the Wall St. Journal to be &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>the best and latest investment advice money can buy&lt;/em>.&amp;rdquo; I’m really happy I finally finished reading this book. I tried reading it for the first time back in 2016 and was not able to do so. At the time, the book was way too advanced for me and I didn’t have the background knowledge to be able to really understand it at a deep level. However over the years, I’ve learned more about finance to the point where I now feel confident when it comes to topics such as saving for retirement, investing in securities, personal finance, etc. I was so happy with finishing the book that I wrote to Dr. Malkiel at his Princeton email address and he responded! I will cherish this memory forever and will always thank Dr. Malkiel for the knowledge that he imparted with me through his book. Here are the top five lessons that I learned from &lt;strong>A Random Walk Down Wall St.&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Volunteering at McKinley Technology High School</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2024-posts/20240130_volunteering_mths/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 18:11:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/cool-event-2024-posts/20240130_volunteering_mths/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20240130_Volunteering_MTHS/robot1.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update (Sat. 3/17/24 @ 1:48 AM EST)&lt;/strong>: I’m writing to give an update on my experiences volunteering at &lt;strong>McKinley Technology High School&lt;/strong> in NE, Washington D.C. I’m also attaching a more recent picture of the robot! It is now a fully functioning robot. Overall it’s been a great experience and I’ve learned so much from the students. I would 100% become a volunteer again (if time avails). I’ve tried to add value to what the student’s have been doing with the robot. But the reality of the situation is that I’ve learned more from them than they’ve learned from me. I never had the opportunities that the students have at McKinley when I was a young person; therefore, it has made me so happy to help support them. I want to update the post because there are some key lessons that I want to remember forever from my experiences at McKinley:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book Review: Titan</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20240130_br_titan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 16:59:48 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20240130_br_titan/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20240130_BR_Titan/cover.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I just finished reading the book &lt;strong>Titan&lt;/strong> by &lt;em>Ron Chernow&lt;/em>. This book was a total tomb! It took me close to a year to crawl through the whole book; I thought at one point that I was never going to finish reading the book! I first held a copy of the book years ago at a friend&amp;rsquo;s apartment and I was always fascinated to learn more about &lt;strong>John D. Rockefeller Sr.&lt;/strong>, who many people consider America’s first billionaire. However, the reality is that Rockfeller never reached one billion dollars net worth in his life; rather at its height, Rockefeller had a net worth of +$900M USD. Regardless of technicalities, this kind of money in the late 19th and early 20th century was unprecedented and his story is a rather crazy one. Born into a broken family, Rockefeller had to leave school at age 16 with a half finished high school education and go work to support himself and his siblings. From working jobs in his youth, to starting his own commodities trading enterprise, to getting into the oil refining business at the right time, this book was the story of a great life. Here are the five biggest lessons I learned from the richest American (adjusted for inflation) of all time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Documentary Review: The Commanding Heights (2002 Documentary)</title><link>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20231225_dr_commanding_heights/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Dec 2023 21:53:38 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://yli12313.github.io/blog/economics-and-finance-posts/20231225_dr_commanding_heights/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://yli12313.github.io/blog/blog/20231225_Commanding_Heights/title.png" alt="p1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just finished watching a documentary series from 2002 called &lt;strong>The Commanding Heights&lt;/strong> based on the book by &lt;em>Daniel Yergin&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Joseph Stanislaw&lt;/em>. This was a really interesting documentary series that I first learned about from an article on the personal finance website &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/100215/10-must-watch-documentaries-finance-professionals.asp">Investopedia&lt;/a>. This documentary series is a three-part series that goes through the history of economics from it&amp;rsquo;s foundation to present day (i.e. the 21st century). Yes, the documentary is super dated because it came out in 2002; I could tell that it was pretty dated because of the music, the advertisements shown, and the people who were interviewed. However, sometimes we can learn a lot from the past and this documentary series is really educational for anyone interested in learning more about economics and global finance. I will summarize my key learnings from each part of the documentary right here.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
